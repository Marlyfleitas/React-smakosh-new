I’m Ismail Ghallou also known as Smakosh, a nickname which was given to me since I was 8 years old by one of my friends’ father, many told me that I was a good student when I was at primary school & that was achieved by playing a lot of offline video games that really made me think to figure out the way out like Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed & the Tomb Raider trilogies etc...

At the last year of primary school I decided to move out to a public school rather than a private one, and during that time I got heavily addicted to Basketball and I was really a good player, specially in the streets, I liked to learn some new tricks from YouTube & go apply them.

Here’s a picture of some medals I got from some tournaments I & my friends won on Football & Basketball.

During middle school, I started exploring more activities like drawing, graffiti, biking, skateboarding & watching Anime and I was still getting good marks even though, during high school I got addicted to Parkour & Free running and it was really a good experience “not to be able to do a backflip and then after a long period of training to actually do it without any excuses like not having gyms in the city I was living in” it was something really amazing, I spent like 2 years practicing and have recorded some videos right [here](https://www.instagram.com/smakosh19).

During the last year of high school I got a gaming pc that my dad bought for me since I've been begging him since middle school, unfortunately it made me get addicted to gaming and as a result I graduated from high school with bad marks.

Fortunately I got accepted in some sort of school which is equivalent to university & at that moment everything has changed, I started educating myself at home, learning, practicing by doing side projects & working as a free lancer from november 2015 until now, I taught myself Graphic, UI/UX design, programming & web development, restudied maths — algebra linear, calculus, probabilities... — & i’m still learning new stuff everyday, I've became really interested in technology & science.
