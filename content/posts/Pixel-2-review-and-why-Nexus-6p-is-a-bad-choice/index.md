I've been using the Nexus 6p for 2 years until recently, I had to upgrade to the Google Pixel 2 for various reasons which are really frustrating to a level that I highly don't recommend buying the Nexus 6p.

I'll walk you through the pros & cons of the Nexus 6p real quick before I move on to the Pixel 2.

Nexus 6p has a really good camera with the Google camera app built in that shots some great pictures combined with HDR, your photos will look amazing (see [examples](https://unsplash.com/@smakosh)) but that uses a huge power of your battery & your phone will end up shutting down in a short period of time & that's the most frustrating thing about the Nexus 6p which is its battery issue, at first it was holding for a long day but eventually it ended up holding for only 3 hours using the phone and only 2 hours or less if mobile data is turned on, the worst thing is when it shuts down at 20% which gets really annoying overtime. As for its display, it's a 2k LED screen but is no match to an Amoled screen. The phone is also big & heavy with a huge bezels on all sides, it's a 2 hands phone & using one hand might eventually hurt your hand. as for the software, it's rocking an Android Oreo 8.1 & will never receive current Android Pie update nor upcoming ones, the unlimited photo storage deal has also ended.

Let's get into the Google Pixel 2 now which most of my Instagram community has voted more for its review.

> Keep in mind, I'm reviewing the Pixel 2 and not the Pixel 2 XL.

I've been using it for a couple of weeks so far, It does take amazing pictures, the portrait mode is epic and provides both the normal picture and the one with the blurring effect, it has the night sight mode that helps to take good looking photos without the need to activate the flash, its Amoled screen is nice but fragile, you might want to get a protective screen if you care about not having any scraches on the screen - I already messed up and scratched mine -.

It's rocking the Android Pie and will receive upcoming updates, as well as you get unlimited photo storage with the original quality, the phone holds for a day but less if you're using it the entire time, I'm satisfied so far regarding the battery life.
