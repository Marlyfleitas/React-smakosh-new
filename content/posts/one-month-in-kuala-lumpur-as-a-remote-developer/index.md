![Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur](malaysia.jpg)

I won’t consider myself a digital nomad but I admit that I was a bit influenced for a short period time to try out that lifestyle, but as I don’t like traveling a lot as I mentioned in my [previous article](/istanbul-trip), I wasn’t really engaged into the idea of continuously traveling & working remotely from anywhere as I’m not sure if I would be able to focus in that way.

I need Sometimes to sit in one place for a long period of time to focus, plan, acquire new skills & practice them, so in that regard, I decided to do a trial before buying the whole experience!

I decided to try to spend the longest period of time in a country in Asia that doesn’t require any visa as I seriously hate bureaucracy, after researching on the web, I come up with the idea of traveling to Malaysia and spend 3 months there (2 months and 17 days to be precise), I knew that Kuala Lumpur’s weather wasn’t healthy and so, I decided to spend the first month there, then move on to Penang to spend my second month to finally get back to KL to eventually move back to my home country.

I actually had other ideas, like going to Bali to spend half of the second month there, but due to Bali’s weather, I decided to spend the whole second month in Penang.

So as a remote developer, I’d like to share my experience with you covering most of the parts that you might worry about before coming here, so let us get started!

## Planing

Before you start packing your stuff & booking your flight, you must plan everything way earlier in order to avoid touristic seasons, so don't rush things out and don't forget to check the weather as well, in my case I planned to get here in between April & June as after June, everyone is in holidays and the area becomes touristic which means everything will be expensive.

## Flight (rebound)

I made a mistake booking my flight late, I should have booked a couple of months earlier to get the price down in between $ 500 - $ 700 from Casablanca, Morocco to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia instead of the actual price I paid which was in between $ 800 - $ 900 with Oman Air & I had to change the plane in Muscat, Oman. Same when I'll be coming back home.

## Housing

The second thing you will look up to is housing, feel free to use what ever you think is better for you, in my case I used AirBnb to book the first month in Shah Alam which is far from KL's center as I wanted to focus on my work & personal side projects a lot more.

Because I rented away from KL's center, the rent cost me approximately ~ \$ 330 for the entire apartment.

## Cash

Malaysia is known as cash only country so you should consider bringing some cash with you along the way, you can check other guides or nomadlist.com for how much you need to afford a living in KL.

## Transportation

Now that you've planned everything, booked your flight, stay & exchanged your money, the first thing that comes in mind is transportation and obviously the first thing you will find online is the numerous warnings not to ride taxis what so ever as they are expensive as they have a tourist's price.

You might have read that you can use Grab as it is the popular ride sharing mobile app in Asia but if you ever ran into the same issues I ran into which were that Grab wasn't working properly and couldn't verify my selfie nor let book a ride with a Malaysian phone number.

In that case, there are alternatives, like a competitor app called myCar which simply offers the same service.
