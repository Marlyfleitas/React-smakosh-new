![Tools](tech.jpg "Taken from my Instagram")

TL;DR I use JavaScript for everything :D

So I thought about sharing the tools I personally use personally or at work, so let’s start with Design tools:

* Adobe Illustrator for logos, icons, illustrations.
* Adobe XD, Invision Studio or Sketch for designing user interfaces & wireframes.
* Adobe Photoshop for editing pictures & memes :D
* Adobe After effects for editing videos (I recommend Adobe Premiere Pro for editing videos & AE to add effects).
* Dribble for inspiration and I share my work there as well as on Behance

Let’s now get into the tools I use while coding:

I share my code & look for inspirations on:

* GitHub
* Codepen
* CodeSandbox

If I’m simply coding an interface that I’ll might integrate into an app (web or native) I use plain html/css & vanilla js.

But if I'm working on a landing page, docs or blog, I use:

* Jekyll or Gatsby (I recommend Gatsby) and I deploy on Netlify.

For Css I’m cool to use what ever tech available out there that makes my task done quickly & well, I have personally used Bootstrap 3 & 4, Bulma, Lostgrid, Materliaze, Tachyons & made my own little framework called Unnamed that has over 180 stars on Github, but I seriously prefer coding with vanilla CSS because I enjoy styling my elements from scratch since the components are fully reusable with React.

If I’m making a web app, for the front-end I use the `create-react-app` boilerplate as it’s the official one from the team that made React Js but I always have to add react-router, Redux, Recompose & many other modules I use the most. So I made my own [boilerplate](https://github.com/smakosh/personal-react-app-boilerplate).

I use Git bash as my terminal when I’m on windows, iTerm2 with "oh my zsh" themes when I’m on macOS & VScode as my code editor (material theme).

For the backend, I was using php/mysql which I didn’t personally like, so I switched to node js meaning that I currently use Express Js/Mongoose and Mongodb as database to make Restful APIs which I deploy on Heroku if it was a mvp and on a Digital Ocean droplet when it's a fully working product. I made my personal [boilerplate](https://github.com/smakosh/rest-api-boilerplate-v2) to speed up the process.

I Forgot to mention that I sometimes use Firebase when I’m too lazy to work on the backend.

For native apps, I use React native to build mobile apps (Ios & Android). I also have a personal [boilerplate](https://github.com/smakosh/RN-personal-boilerplate) that I use to speed up the process.

For growth hacking, I focus more on building useful products that users really need in their lives then I simply share it on Product Hunt, Hacker news, Reddit and on social media.

I use Windows 10, MacOs Mojave, my MSI GP62 laptop, my macBook Pro 2017 touchbar work laptop, Nexus 6p with a Dbrand wood skin. Full setup can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1falYEEHhJxq4HIXwOPoc4lk0AYsfHY4U6ZCcY4Srs8g/edit?usp=sharing).
